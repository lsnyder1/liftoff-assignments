Bootiful Testing

Test Driven Development


I wasn't sure what to expect by the title.  I knew it would involve java, spring and I assumed script testing.


I did not have any specific questions going into this meetup.

The presenters Josh Long and Mario Gray led a very informative and enjoyable presentation.  They dealt with topics from custom ASCII art gifs in spring to script testing and spring tools to make testing in a production environment easier and more accurate.  I followed the presentation for the most part but only had experience with a handful of the spring tools they were using. I left with a couple free books by the speaker and an amazon gift card I won in a raffle.  I will be attending another st louis java users meetup.
